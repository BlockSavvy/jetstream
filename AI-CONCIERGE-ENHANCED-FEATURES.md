# JetShare AI Concierge Enhanced Features

## Overview

We've enhanced the AI Concierge with advanced capabilities to provide a more powerful, intuitive, and natural user experience. These improvements focus on direct action capabilities, voice interactions, and multimodal experiences.

## New Features

### 1. OpenAI Function Calling

The AI Concierge can now directly execute structured tasks in our backend through function calls:

- **CreateJetShareOffer**: Create new JetShare listings with structured fields
- **FindJetShareOffer**: Search for available offers matching specific criteria
- **ScheduleNotification**: Set up reminders and notifications
- **BookAmenities**: Book additional services for flights
- **ScheduleTransportation**: Arrange ground transportation

Function calling provides a more reliable and structured way for the AI to take actions based on user requests, without relying on complex string parsing.

### 2. Voice Mode (Multimodal Interaction)

Users can now interact with the concierge through natural voice conversations:

- **Speech-to-Text**: Using OpenAI's Whisper API for accurate transcription
- **Text-to-Speech**: Using ElevenLabs for high-quality, natural-sounding responses
- **Fluid Conversation**: Seamless transitions between voice and text

Voice mode enables hands-free interactions, making the concierge more accessible while driving, walking, or in situations where typing is inconvenient.

### 3. Improved Mobile-First UI

The UI has been enhanced to support multimodal interactions:

- **Voice Controls**: Intuitive microphone button with visual feedback
- **Audio Visualization**: Waveform display during voice recording
- **Mode Switching**: Easy toggle between text and voice modes
- **Audio Playback**: Controls for replaying AI responses

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

1. **Database Schema**:
   - Added `concierge_voice_sessions` table for voice interactions
   - Added `concierge_function_calls` table for tracking actions
   - Enhanced `concierge_conversations` table with interaction types
   - Updated relationships between tables

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/concierge/transcribe`: Converts speech to text using Whisper
   - `/api/concierge/speak`: Converts text to speech using ElevenLabs
   - `/api/concierge/functions/*`: Dedicated endpoints for each function type

3. **AI Inference Layer**:
   - Updated `AIInferenceClient` interface with function calling support
   - Enhanced streaming to handle function calls and responses
   - Added voice processing capabilities

### Frontend Changes

1. **Enhanced Chat Component**:
   - Added voice recording and playback controls
   - Integrated waveform visualization
   - Implemented real-time transcription feedback
   - Added function call status indicators

2. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Visual indicators for different interaction modes
   - Smooth transitions between voice and text
   - Function call progress indicators

## Usage Examples

### Creating a JetShare Offer via Voice

User can simply say:
> "I'd like to offer two seats on my flight from New York to Miami this Friday at 2pm. I paid $12,000 for the jet, so let's charge $3,000 per seat."

The AI will:

1. Transcribe the voice input
2. Extract the intent and details
3. Call the `CreateJetShareOffer` function
4. Confirm the creation with both voice and text

### Finding Available JetShares

User can type or say:
> "Find me a flight to Los Angeles next weekend under $5,000"

The AI will:

1. Recognize the search intent
2. Call the `FindJetShareOffer` function with structured parameters
3. Present the results in a conversational format
4. Offer to book or set up notifications

## Environment Variables

To enable these features, the following environment variables must be set:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Function Calling**: Ask the concierge to perform specific tasks like creating an offer
2. **Voice Mode**: Click the microphone icon and speak your request
3. **Multimodal**: Try switching between voice and text within the same conversation

## Deployment Notes

Both the OpenAI and xAI Grok implementations have been updated with these features, with minor differences in how function calling is handled (as the xAI API has a slightly different implementation approach).

## Future Enhancements

- Proactive notifications based on user preferences
- Context-aware responses based on location and time
- Multi-language support through translation APIs
- Rich media responses (images, maps, etc.)
- Persistent voice preferences (voice type, speed)
