# AI Concierge & Embeddings Layer Enhancement

## Overview
This PR completes the AI Concierge feature and significantly enhances the embeddings layer for production readiness. The enhancements improve semantic search capabilities, add robust fallback mechanisms, and implement real-time indexing of new content.

## Changes

### Embedding Layer Improvements
- Enhanced `encode()` and `batchEncode()` functions to support multiple providers (Cohere, OpenAI)
- Added input_type parameter support for better query vs. document embeddings
- Implemented robust fallback to OpenAI when Cohere is unavailable
- Added comprehensive logging and monitoring system for embeddings

### Real-Time Indexing
- Added immediate embedding of new JetShare offers upon creation
- Created embedding queue system for retry of failed embedding operations
- Implemented queue processor for batch handling of pending embeddings

### AI Concierge Enhancements
- Updated concierge endpoints to use improved embeddings service
- Enhanced JetShare search with semantic matching
- Added fallback to regular flights when no matching JetShare offers are found

### Admin Monitoring
- Added embedding analytics dashboard at `/admin/embeddings`
- Implemented tracking of provider usage, success rates, and fallback frequency
- Created API endpoints for monitoring embedding performance

## Testing
- Verified real-time indexing of new offers
- Tested semantic search functionality with natural language queries
- Confirmed fallback mechanisms work correctly
- Validated provider switching and error handling
- Tested admin analytics dashboard

## Production Readiness Checks
- Verified environment variables are configured correctly
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing features
- Added queue-based resilience for embedding operations

## Notes
This PR completes the AI Concierge feature and makes our embeddings infrastructure production-ready. The improved system ensures that all content is immediately available for semantic search and that the system is resilient against API failures.

## API Changes
- New `/api/embedding/*` endpoints for indexing and monitoring
- Updated encode() function signature to support provider selection and input types
