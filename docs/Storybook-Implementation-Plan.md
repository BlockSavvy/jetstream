# Storybook Implementation Plan

This document outlines our plan for implementing a comprehensive Storybook documentation for the Jetstream platform. The goal is to create a well-organized, useful reference for the design team to understand our components and give feedback on future improvements.

## Project Structure

Our Storybook will be organized into the following main sections:

1. **Core UI Components**
   - Basic UI elements (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)

2. **JetStream Platform**
   - Pulse AI Components
   - AI Concierge
   - Dashboard Components

3. **JetShare Mobile App**
   - Core JetShare Components
   - Booking Flow
   - Payment Components

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Cleanup (Immediate)

- [x] ~~Remove mock components from stories/mocks/pulse/~~
- [ ] Delete mock component stories from stories/features/pulse/ that reference non-existent components
- [ ] Create a new branch for implementation: `feature/storybook-real-components`

### Phase 2: JetStream Platform Components

#### Pulse AI Components

- [ ] **PulseHero** - Create story using real component from app/pulse/components/PulseHero.tsx
- [ ] **PulseQuestionnaire** - Create/Update story using real component from app/pulse/components/PulseQuestionnaire.tsx
- [ ] **TrendingFlights** - Create/Update story using real component from app/pulse/components/TrendingFlights.tsx
- [ ] **ExclusiveFlights** - Create/Update story using real component from app/pulse/components/ExclusiveFlights.tsx
- [ ] **PulseAlerts** - Create story using real component from app/pulse/components/PulseAlerts.tsx
- [ ] **PulseRecommendations** - Create story using real component from app/dashboard/components/PulseRecommendations.tsx

#### AI Concierge Components

- [ ] **AIConcierge** - Update story to properly reference real component from app/components/voice/AIConcierge.tsx
- [ ] Create detailed documentation for this component

### Phase 3: JetShare Mobile App Components

- [ ] **JetShareHeader** - Create story using app/jetshare/components/JetShareHeader.tsx 
- [ ] **JetShareOfferForm** - Create story using app/jetshare/components/JetShareOfferForm.tsx
- [ ] **JetShareListingsContent** - Create story using app/jetshare/components/JetShareListingsContent.tsx
- [ ] **JetSelector** - Create story using app/jetshare/components/JetSelector.tsx
- [ ] **JetShareDashboard** - Create story using app/jetshare/components/JetShareDashboard.tsx
- [ ] **JetSharePaymentForm** - Create story using app/jetshare/components/JetSharePaymentForm.tsx
- [ ] **BoardingPassButton** - Create story using app/jetshare/components/BoardingPassButton.tsx
- [ ] **JetSeatVisualizer** - Create story using app/jetshare/components/JetSeatVisualizer.tsx
- [ ] **LocationAutocomplete** - Create story using app/jetshare/components/LocationAutocomplete.tsx

### Phase 4: Documentation Enhancement

- [ ] Update existing Introduction.mdx files with comprehensive information
- [ ] Create documentation about testing with Storybook stories
- [ ] Create documentation about component patterns and best practices
- [ ] Add responsive design previews for all components

## Component Story Types

For each component, we'll include the following story types as applicable:

1. **Overview** - Documentation and explanation of the component
2. **Playground** - Interactive version with all props available via controls
3. **Feature Stories** - Different states and variants (loading, error, success, etc.)
4. **Recipe Stories** - Examples of components used together in common patterns

## Quality Standards

All story documentation should adhere to the following standards:

1. **Professional Language** - Clear, concise, and professional writing style
2. **Complete Context** - Explanation of the component's purpose in the overall JetStream ecosystem
3. **Technical Accuracy** - Correctly document props, behaviors, and integration points
4. **Design Guidelines** - Include relevant design guidelines and specifications
5. **Accessibility Notes** - Document accessibility considerations

## Testing Integration

Stories should be written in a way that they can be reused for automated testing, following the "Stories are Tests" principle from Storybook's documentation.

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (Cleanup): Immediate
- Phase 2 (JetStream Components): 1-2 days
- Phase 3 (JetShare Components): 2-3 days
- Phase 4 (Documentation Enhancement): 1-2 days

## Deliverables

1. Comprehensive Storybook with all major components documented
2. Interactive examples of each component with various states
3. Clear documentation for designers and developers
4. Integration with existing testing framework where applicable
