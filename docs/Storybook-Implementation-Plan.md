# Storybook Implementation Plan

This document outlines our plan for implementing a comprehensive Storybook documentation for the Jetstream platform. The goal is to create a well-organized, useful reference for designers and developers to understand our components and enable informed decisions for future improvements.

## Project Structure

Our Storybook will be organized into the following main sections:

1. **Core UI Components**
   - Basic UI elements (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)

2. **JetStream Platform**
   - Pulse AI Components
   - AI Concierge
   - Dashboard Components

3. **JetShare Mobile App**
   - Core JetShare Components
   - Booking Flow
   - Payment Components

### Responsive Design Guidelines

Each component story now includes:

- Mobile view (< 640px)
- Tablet view (640px - 1024px)
- Desktop view (> 1024px)
- Interactive viewport resizer in Storybook
- Responsive behavior documentation

### User Personas

We've documented how components serve these key personas:

1. **Executive Traveler** - High-net-worth individuals who prioritize efficiency and luxury
2. **Family Traveler** - Groups requiring special accommodations and simplified booking
3. **Corporate Travel Manager** - Responsible for organizing and managing team travel
4. **First-time Private Flyer** - Needs clear guidance and reassurance in the booking process

## Component Story Types

For each component, we've included the following story types as applicable:

1. **Overview** - Documentation and explanation of the component
2. **Playground** - Interactive version with all props available via controls
3. **Feature Stories** - Different states and variants (loading, error, success, etc.)
4. **Recipe Stories** - Examples of components used together in common patterns
5. **Accessibility Examples** - Demonstrations of accessible usage patterns

## Quality Standards

All story documentation adheres to the following standards:

1. **Professional Language** - Clear, concise, and professional writing style
2. **Complete Context** - Explanation of the component's purpose in the overall JetStream ecosystem
3. **Technical Accuracy** - Correctly document props, behaviors, and integration points
4. **Design Guidelines** - Include relevant design guidelines and specifications
5. **Accessibility Notes** - Document accessibility considerations
6. **Plain Language** - Documentation should be understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Testing Integration

Stories have been written in a way that they can be reused for automated testing, following the "Stories are Tests" principle from Storybook's documentation.
