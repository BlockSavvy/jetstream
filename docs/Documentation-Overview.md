# Jetstream Documentation Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Jetstream documentation suite, including the Storybook component library and associated documentation files.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation for Jetstream is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Storybook Component Library

Located at `http://localhost:6006` when running `npm run storybook`, our Storybook instance provides interactive documentation for all UI components.

The Storybook is organized into the following main sections:

- **UI Components**: Core building blocks for the application, including buttons, cards, inputs, etc.
- **Jetshare Components**: Mobile-first components specific to the Jetshare feature.
- **Introduction**: An overview of the component library and design principles.

### 2. Documentation Files

Documentation files are stored in the `/docs` directory and include:

- **Storybook-Readme.md**: Guide to using and extending the Storybook documentation.
- **Jetshare-Components.md**: Guidelines for documenting Jetshare-specific components.
- **Documentation-Overview.md** (this file): Overview of the entire documentation structure.

### 3. Component Documentation

Each component in the Storybook has associated documentation:

- Interactive examples
- Props and API documentation
- Accessibility guidelines
- Usage examples

## Running the Documentation Suite

### Storybook

To run Storybook locally:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will start Storybook on port 6006. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view the component library.

### Building Storybook

To create a static build of Storybook for deployment:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

The built files will be generated in the `storybook-static` directory.

## Component Documentation Guidelines

When documenting components, follow these guidelines:

1. **Complete Examples**: Show all possible states and variants of the component
2. **Accessibility**: Include information about accessibility features and considerations
3. **Props Documentation**: Document all props with types and descriptions
4. **Usage Examples**: Show common usage patterns
5. **Edge Cases**: Document how the component handles edge cases

## Jetshare Mobile-First Documentation

The Jetshare feature has its own dedicated section in the documentation to address its mobile-first requirements:

1. **Responsive Testing**: All Jetshare components are tested across multiple viewport sizes
2. **Touch Interactions**: Documentation includes touch-specific interaction patterns
3. **Device-Specific Features**: Any device-specific features or limitations are documented

## Contributing to Documentation

To contribute to the documentation:

1. Follow the guidelines in Storybook-Readme.md for component stories
2. Follow the guidelines in Jetshare-Components.md for mobile components
3. Run Storybook locally to verify your documentation
4. Submit your changes via a pull request

## Deployment

The Storybook documentation can be deployed to a static hosting service:

1. Build the Storybook: `npm run build-storybook`
2. Deploy the `storybook-static` directory to your hosting service
3. Set up continuous deployment to update the documentation automatically

## Integration with Design System

The documentation is integrated with our design system in the following ways:

1. Components follow the design system specifications
2. Colors, typography, and spacing align with the design system
3. Design tokens are documented and used consistently

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the documentation:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
2. Check for conflicts in `.storybook/main.ts` configuration
3. Verify that imports are correctly defined in your stories
4. Consult the error messages in the browser console or terminal

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements to the documentation include:

1. Adding more Jetshare components
2. Enhancing accessibility documentation
3. Implementing visual regression testing
4. Creating a design token documentation section
