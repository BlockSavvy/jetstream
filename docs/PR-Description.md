# Storybook Documentation for Real Components

## Overview
This PR implements comprehensive Storybook documentation for the actual Jetstream components, especially focusing on the AI features. It provides a structured organization that helps designers and developers understand the component ecosystem.

## Changes

### Major Changes
- Created Storybook documentation for real components instead of mock ones
- Reorganized the story structure to reflect the actual application structure
- Implemented proper state handling (loading, error, default) for components that fetch data
- Added comprehensive documentation for each component

### Components Documented
- **Pulse AI Components**
  - TrendingFlights
  - ExclusiveFlights
  - PulseQuestionnaire

### Implementation Details
- Used React's useEffect hook to mock API responses in stories
- Created wrappers to handle different states of components
- Added detailed documentation about component purpose and functionality
- Implemented the same state management patterns used in the actual components

## Testing
The Storybook has been tested locally to ensure all documented components render correctly and showcase their various states effectively.

## Next Steps
- Complete documentation for remaining Pulse AI components
- Add JetShare mobile app components
- Enhance integration between components in "recipe" stories
- Add accessibility compliance documentation
