- **Personalization Engine** - Creating tailored experiences for each user

## Key Components

The JetShare UI includes several specialized components:

- **JetShareHeader**: Navigation and branding for the JetShare experience
- **JetShareOfferDetail**: Displays details of available jet sharing opportunities
- **JetShareOfferForm**: Complex form for creating new jet share listings
- **JetSeatVisualizer**: Interactive component for selecting seats on an aircraft

- **JetShareDashboard**: User dashboard for managing bookings and listings
- **BoardingPass**: Digital boarding pass generation and display

## User Journey

JetShare enables a seamless experience from discovery to boarding:

1. Users browse available jet sharing opportunities
2. They select a flight and choose their seat
3. Payment is processed for their share of the flight
4. Digital boarding passes are generated
5. Users board and enjoy their premium flight experience

## Responsive Design Guidelines

### Viewport Considerations

JetShare components are designed to work across the following viewport sizes:

- **Mobile Small**: 320px - 375px
- **Mobile Large**: 376px - 639px
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1023px
- **Desktop**: 1024px and above

### Component-Specific Responsive Patterns

#### JetSeatVisualizer

- Mobile: Zoomed view with panning gesture support
- Tablet: Visible cabin with touch selection
- Desktop: Full aircraft view with hover states

#### JetShareOfferForm

- Mobile: Single-field focus, progressive disclosure
- Tablet: Grouped fields, side-by-side when appropriate
- Desktop: Multi-column layout with contextual help

#### LocationAutocomplete

- Mobile: Full-screen search experience
- Tablet/Desktop: Dropdown result list
- All: Persistent recent searches

## Implementation Status

All components are fully documented with comprehensive stories showcasing their functionality, states, and integration points across mobile viewports.

# Jetshare UI Components

Jetshare is a mobile-first feature of the Jetstream platform that enables users to book and share private jet flights. This documentation covers the UI components specifically built for the Jetshare experience.

## Key Components

The Jetshare UI includes several specialized components:

- **JetShareHeader**: Navigation and branding for the Jetshare experience
- **JetShareOfferDetail**: Displays details of available jet sharing opportunities
- **JetShareOfferForm**: Complex form for creating new jet share listings
- **JetSeatVisualizer**: Interactive component for selecting seats on an aircraft
- **LocationAutocomplete**: Search and select airports with autocomplete
- **JetSharePaymentForm**: Secure payment processing for booking seats
- **JetShareDashboard**: User dashboard for managing bookings and listings
- **BoardingPass**: Digital boarding pass generation and display

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing Jetshare components:

1. **Responsiveness**: All components must adapt seamlessly across device sizes
2. **Performance**: Components should load quickly, even on slower mobile connections
3. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for mobile accessibility
4. **Offline Support**: Where possible, components should gracefully handle intermittent connectivity

## Comprehensive Responsive Design Guidelines

### Viewport Considerations

Jetshare components are designed to work across the following viewport sizes:

- **Mobile Small**: 320px - 375px
- **Mobile Large**: 376px - 639px
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1023px
- **Desktop**: 1024px and above

### Responsive Design Techniques

Our responsive approach uses these key techniques:

1. **Fluid Layout Grids**:
   - Mobile: Single column with 16px margin
   - Tablet: Two-column with 24px margin
   - Desktop: Multi-column with 32px+ margin

2. **Touch Targets**:
   - Minimum 44Ã—44px for all interactive elements
   - Increased spacing between interactive elements (minimum 8px)
   - Larger hit areas for primary actions

3. **Typography Scaling**:
   ```css
   /* Base mobile typography */
   h1 { font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.2; }
   h2 { font-size: 1.25rem; line-height: 1.2; }
   body { font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.5; }
   
   /* Tablet and above */
   @media (min-width: 640px) {
     h1 { font-size: 2rem; }
     h2 { font-size: 1.5rem; }
   }
   
   /* Desktop */
   @media (min-width: 1024px) {
     h1 { font-size: 2.5rem; }
     h2 { font-size: 1.75rem; }
   }
   ```

4. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Core functionality works on all devices
   - Enhanced interactions on desktop (hover states, tooltips)
   - Touch-optimized interactions on mobile

### Testing Responsive Implementations

To validate responsive behavior:

1. **Device Testing Checklist**:
   - iPhone SE (smallest common viewport)
   - iPhone 12/13/14 (average mobile)
   - iPad (tablet)
   - Desktop monitor

2. **Simulated Conditions**:
   - Slow network connections (throttled to 3G)
   - Touch input vs. mouse input
   - Various pixel densities
   - Portrait and landscape orientations

3. **Testing Tools**:
   - Storybook Viewports addon
   - Chrome DevTools device simulation
   - BrowserStack for real device testing

## Design System Integration

Jetshare components build upon the base Jetstream UI components but add mobile-optimized variations and Jetshare-specific styling.

The design uses a simplified color palette optimized for mobile screens and incorporates larger touch targets for improved usability on touchscreens.

## Offline-First Approach

Jetshare components implement:

1. **Data Persistence**: Local storage caching for important user data
2. **Optimistic UI**: Update UI before network confirmation
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful retry mechanisms and clear offline indicators
4. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens instead of spinners
5. **Background Sync**: Queue operations when offline for later execution

## Performance Benchmarks

All Jetshare components must meet these performance metrics:

- First meaningful paint < 1.5s on 3G connections
- Time to interactive < 3s on average mobile devices
- Total bundle size < 150KB (initial load)
- Smooth scrolling (60fps) even during network operations
