# Jetshare UI Components

Jetshare is a mobile-first feature of the Jetstream platform that enables users to book and share private jet flights. This documentation covers the UI components specifically built for the Jetshare experience.

## Mobile-First Design

All Jetshare components are designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets, while still functioning well on desktop devices.

## Key Components

The Jetshare UI includes several specialized components:

- **JetShareHeader**: Navigation and branding for the Jetshare experience
- **JetShareOfferDetail**: Displays details of available jet sharing opportunities
- **JetShareOfferForm**: Complex form for creating new jet share listings
- **JetSeatVisualizer**: Interactive component for selecting seats on an aircraft
- **LocationAutocomplete**: Search and select airports with autocomplete
- **JetSharePaymentForm**: Secure payment processing for booking seats
- **JetShareDashboard**: User dashboard for managing bookings and listings
- **BoardingPass**: Digital boarding pass generation and display

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing Jetshare components:

1. **Responsiveness**: All components must adapt seamlessly across device sizes
2. **Performance**: Components should load quickly, even on slower mobile connections
3. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for mobile accessibility
4. **Offline Support**: Where possible, components should gracefully handle intermittent connectivity

## Design System Integration

Jetshare components build upon the base Jetstream UI components but add mobile-optimized variations and Jetshare-specific styling.

The design uses a simplified color palette optimized for mobile screens and incorporates larger touch targets for improved usability on touchscreens.

## Testing on Mobile Devices

All Jetshare components should be tested on multiple devices and in various network conditions. The Storybook mobile addon can be used to simulate different viewport sizes during development.
