# Pulse AI Matching System

The Pulse AI system is Jetstream's intelligent matching system that connects users with optimal flight options, partnerships, and travel opportunities based on complex preference analysis.

## System Overview

Pulse AI analyzes user preferences, historical data, and current market conditions to provide highly personalized flight recommendations. The system consists of several interconnected components:

### Key Components

- **PreferenceAnalyzer**: Processes user preferences and historical choices
- **MatchingEngine**: Core algorithm that ranks and scores potential matches
- **RecommendationDisplay**: UI components for displaying AI-powered recommendations
- **FeedbackLoop**: Components for capturing user feedback to improve recommendations

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing Pulse AI components:

1. **Performance**: Matching operations should be optimized for speed and efficiency
2. **Accuracy**: Components should prioritize recommendation relevance
3. **Transparency**: Users should understand why recommendations are made
4. **Privacy**: All components must handle user data according to privacy guidelines

## Technical Architecture

The Pulse AI system uses a combination of:

- Vector embeddings for preference analysis
- Machine learning models for matching
- Real-time data processing for market condition analysis
- Feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement

## Component Showcase

This section of Storybook documents the various UI components used in the Pulse AI system:

1. **Recommendation Cards**: Display flight matches with relevance scores
2. **Preference Forms**: Allow users to input and update their preferences
3. **Match Explanation UI**: Explain why certain matches were recommended
4. **Feedback Components**: Capture user satisfaction with recommendations

## Integration Points

Pulse AI components integrate with:

- **User Profile System**: To access user preferences and history
- **Flight Database**: To match against available inventory
- **Payment System**: To factor in budget considerations
- **Notification System**: To alert users about high-quality matches
