# Pulse AI Matching System

The Pulse AI system is Jetstream's intelligent matching system that connects users with optimal flight options, partnerships, and travel opportunities based on complex preference analysis.

## System Overview

Pulse AI analyzes user preferences, historical data, and current market conditions to provide highly personalized flight recommendations. The system consists of several interconnected components:

### Key Components

- **PreferenceAnalyzer**: Processes user preferences and historical choices
- **MatchingEngine**: Core algorithm that ranks and scores potential matches
- **RecommendationDisplay**: UI components for displaying AI-powered recommendations
- **FeedbackLoop**: Components for capturing user feedback to improve recommendations

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing Pulse AI components:

1. **Performance**: Matching operations should be optimized for speed and efficiency
2. **Accuracy**: Components should prioritize recommendation relevance
3. **Transparency**: Users should understand why recommendations are made
4. **Privacy**: All components must handle user data according to privacy guidelines

## Technical Architecture

The Pulse AI system uses a combination of:

- Vector embeddings for preference analysis
- Machine learning models for matching
- Real-time data processing for market condition analysis
- Feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement

## Component Patterns and Best Practices

### PulseQuestionnaire Component

The PulseQuestionnaire is a multi-step form that collects user preferences to power personalized recommendations. It should follow these patterns:

```tsx
// Basic Implementation
<PulseQuestionnaire
  steps={[
    {
      id: "destinations",
      title: "Preferred Destinations",
      description: "Select destinations you're interested in visiting",
      component: DestinationSelector
    },
    {
      id: "timing",
      title: "Travel Timing",
      description: "When do you typically travel?",
      component: TimingSelector
    }
  ]}
  onComplete={(preferences) => savePulsePreferences(preferences)}
  currentStep={currentStep}
  onStepChange={(step) => setCurrentStep(step)}
/>
```

#### Best Practices:

- Limit questionnaire to 5-7 steps maximum
- Provide progress indicator showing completion status
- Allow users to save progress and return later
- Use visual elements to make selection engaging
- Implement smart defaults based on user history when available
- Always include a "skip" option for optional questions
- Explain how data improves the recommendation experience

### PulseRecommendations Component

The PulseRecommendations component displays AI-generated flight suggestions and should:

```tsx
// Basic Implementation
<PulseRecommendations
  userId={currentUser.id}
  limit={10}
  filters={{
    priceRange: [1000, 5000],
    departureAirports: userPreferredAirports,
    travelDates: selectedDateRange
  }}
  onRecommendationSelected={(rec) => viewDetails(rec.id)}
  onFeedbackGiven={(feedback) => processFeedback(feedback)}
/>
```

#### Implementation Pattern:

1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Header with explanation of recommendation logic
   - Filtering controls for user refinement
   - Grid or list of recommendation cards
   - Load more / pagination controls
   - Empty state handling when no recommendations available

2. **Card Components**:
   - Clear pricing and availability indicators
   - Prominent destination imagery
   - Relevance score with explanation
   - Quick action buttons (save, book, share)
   - Visual distinction for exclusive or limited-time offers

3. **State Management**:
   - Loading states with skeleton screens
   - Graceful error handling
   - Optimistic UI updates for interactions
   - Caching of recommendation data

### TrendingFlights Component

The TrendingFlights component displays popular and trending flight options:

```tsx
<TrendingFlights
  region="NORTH_AMERICA"
  timeframe="NEXT_30_DAYS"
  limit={6}
  onFlightSelected={(flight) => viewFlightDetails(flight.id)}
/>
```

Best practices for trending displays:
- Clearly indicate why items are trending ("33% increase in bookings")
- Refresh data periodically but avoid disruptive UI changes
- Implement smooth transitions between data updates
- Include social proof elements where appropriate
- Allow personalization of trends by region or category

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Use logical tab order following visual layout
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Ensure visible focus states meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Screen Reader Considerations

- All UI elements must have appropriate ARIA attributes
- Ensure proper heading structure for navigation
- Provide text alternatives for all visual elements
- Use proper landmark regions to aid navigation
- Test with screen readers on multiple platforms

### Color and Contrast

- All text must meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio against backgrounds
- Use patterns in addition to color for data visualization 
- Provide sufficient contrast between UI elements
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Test with color blindness simulators

### Motion and Animation

- Respect user preferences for reduced motion
- Provide controls to pause or disable animations
- Ensure animations do not flash (3Hz or below)
- Implement smooth transitions that aid understanding
- Use animation purposefully, not decoratively

## Component Showcase

This section documents the various UI components used in the Pulse AI system:

1. **Recommendation Cards**: Display flight matches with relevance scores
2. **Preference Forms**: Allow users to input and update their preferences
3. **Match Explanation UI**: Explain why certain matches were recommended
4. **Feedback Components**: Capture user satisfaction with recommendations

### TrendingFlights Component Variants

The TrendingFlights component supports multiple display modes:

1. **Grid View**: Default display for desktop interfaces
   ```tsx
   <TrendingFlights display="grid" columns={3} />
   ```

2. **Carousel View**: Touch-optimized scrolling display
   ```tsx
   <TrendingFlights display="carousel" itemsToShow={1.5} />
   ```

3. **List View**: Compact display for space-constrained interfaces
   ```tsx
   <TrendingFlights display="list" compact={true} />
   ```

4. **Featured View**: Highlight special offers with enhanced visuals
   ```tsx
   <TrendingFlights display="featured" highlight="WEEKEND_GETAWAYS" />
   ```

### PulseAlerts Component Patterns

PulseAlerts notify users about relevant flight opportunities and should follow these patterns:

```tsx
<PulseAlerts
  userId={currentUser.id}
  preferences={userPreferences}
  onAlertDismissed={(alertId) => dismissAlert(alertId)}
  onAlertSelected={(alertId) => viewAlertDetails(alertId)}
  maxAlerts={5}
  refreshInterval={60000} // 1 minute in milliseconds
/>
```

Alerts should:
- Be ordered by relevance and urgency
- Include clear expiration indicators for time-sensitive offers
- Provide one-click actions (book, save, dismiss)
- Use appropriate urgency indicators (color, icon)
- Support filtering by type or destination
- Remember dismissed alerts to avoid repeated notifications

## User Personas and Personalization

Pulse components should adapt to these primary user personas:

1. **Deal Seeker**: Prioritize price comparisons and limited-time offers
   ```tsx
   <PulseRecommendations persona="DEAL_SEEKER" emphasisOn="PRICING" />
   ```

2. **Luxury Traveler**: Emphasize premium experiences and exclusive access
   ```tsx
   <PulseRecommendations persona="LUXURY" emphasisOn="EXPERIENCE" />
   ```

3. **Business Traveler**: Focus on convenience, efficiency, and schedule
   ```tsx
   <PulseRecommendations persona="BUSINESS" emphasisOn="CONVENIENCE" />
   ```

4. **Adventure Seeker**: Highlight unique destinations and experiences
   ```tsx
   <PulseRecommendations persona="ADVENTURE" emphasisOn="UNIQUENESS" />
   ```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing

All Pulse components should have:

1. **Unit Tests**: For component logic and rendering
2. **Integration Tests**: For API interactions and state management
3. **Visual Regression Tests**: To ensure consistent appearance
4. **Accessibility Tests**: To verify WCAG compliance
5. **Performance Tests**: To measure rendering and data processing speed

### A/B Testing Framework

Pulse components support variant testing through:

```tsx
<PulseExperiment
  id="recommendation-layout-test"
  variants={[
    { id: "control", component: StandardLayout, weight: 0.5 },
    { id: "variant-a", component: EnhancedLayout, weight: 0.25 },
    { id: "variant-b", component: CompactLayout, weight: 0.25 }
  ]}
  onImpressionLogged={(variantId) => logImpression(variantId)}
  onConversionTracked={(variantId, event) => trackConversion(variantId, event)}
/>
```

## Integration Points

Pulse AI components integrate with:

- **User Profile System**: To access user preferences and history
- **Flight Database**: To match against available inventory
- **Payment System**: To factor in budget considerations
- **Notification System**: To alert users about high-quality matches
