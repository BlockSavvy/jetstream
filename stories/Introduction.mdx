# Welcome to Jetstream UI Components

This Storybook contains a comprehensive collection of UI components used throughout the Jetstream application. Use this resource to explore, test, and learn how to implement our design system.

## Component Categories

Our components are organized into the following categories:

- **UI Components**: Basic building blocks like buttons, cards, inputs
- **Layout Components**: Components for structuring page layouts
- **Navigation Components**: Menus, navbars, and navigation controls
- **Form Components**: Form controls and validation
- **Feedback Components**: Notifications, alerts, and other user feedback

## Getting Started

1. Browse components using the sidebar navigation
2. Interact with components using the controls panel
3. View component code by clicking the "Show code" button
4. Check accessibility with the Accessibility tab

## Design Principles

Our components follow these core principles:

1. **Consistency**: Components share common styles and behaviors
2. **Accessibility**: All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
3. **Responsiveness**: Components work across all device sizes
4. **Modularity**: Components can be composed to create complex UIs
5. **Performance**: Components are optimized for performance

## Contributing

To contribute new components or improve existing ones, please:

1. Follow the component structure and naming conventions
2. Ensure all components are properly documented
3. Include examples of all component variants
4. Test components for accessibility issues
5. Review the [Component Guidelines](/docs/Storybook-Readme) before submitting
