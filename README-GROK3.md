# xAI Grok-3 Inference Layer Testing

This branch contains the implementation of the xAI Grok-3 model for the AI inference testing framework in JetStream/JetShare.

## Setup

This branch includes:

1. A standardized `AIInferenceClient` interface that defines the contract for inference implementations
2. A minimal chat UI for testing inference responses
3. Integration with xAI Grok-3 API (to be implemented)

## Implementation Steps

The core implementation will involve:

- [ ] Creating a Grok-3 specific client that implements the AIInferenceClient interface
- [ ] Adding proper API key and configuration management for xAI services
- [ ] Implementing streaming and non-streaming completion methods
- [ ] Testing and optimizing the implementation

## Testing

A test environment is available at `/dashboard/test-chat` where you can interact with the model and test its responses.

## Configuration

Configuration will be handled through environment variables:

```
XAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
XAI_MODEL_NAME=grok-3 (or other model variant)
```

## Deployment

This branch is configured for automatic Vercel preview deployment, allowing easy testing of the xAI implementation in isolation before merging.
